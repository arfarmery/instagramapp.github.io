*Exploring the edges of my filter bubble*
Online recommender systems, says Pariser. I found intelligent mobile matchmaking or IM3 tech to really wow me and have spent time reading  [this](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SJpc_oFh_HMC&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=intelligent+mobile+matchmaking+im3&source=bl&ots=DnfKslt35b&sig=yKYC18KYAXEHczZ_befWq4FyjrE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlsd-ymMDJAhUEHD4KHeTTAQYQ6AEILDAC)It is what Tinder uses too and where I beleive the future of computational decision making lies.

## Broken code
I wrote two versions of the application in the end and they are both available on github [here](https://github.com/arfarmery/instagramapp.github.io)
Instaapp-search [here](https://github.com/arfarmery/instagramapp.github.io/tree/master/instaapp-search)
Instagramv2 [here](https://github.com/arfarmery/instagramapp.github.io/tree/master/instagramv2)
I don't understand why I wasnt able to get anywhere without the OAuth access_token. Everyhting I have watched uses a client_ID to get them everythign they need but I'm still prompted an error because of acess_token. 

## Working code
If I could of got the app hosted on github pages, maybe that is where you send a url request to the user to authenticate? I tried to make a gh-pages but still confused as to what a branch will do. I'm really annoyed at myself for not knowing more - have to learn someway. I also think I hosted the app in the wrong place. Can you not put any other files in github apart from code?
